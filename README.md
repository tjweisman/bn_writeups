SUMRY Brill-Noether graph theory writeups
===========

This repository contains TeX files for results and conjectures made by
the Brill-Noether graph theory SUMRY team (Lou Gaudet, Nick Wawrykow,
Teddy Weisman).

We include files for our final project writeup/paper, our poster
presentation at the Yale REU miniconference in July 2014, and our
beamer talk at MathFest 2014.

This part of the project focuses on determining which finite abelian
groups with pairing appear as the Jacobians of graphs. We explored
both simple graphs and multigraphs throughout the project.
