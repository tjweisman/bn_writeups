SUMRY Brill-Noether graph theory writeups
===========

This repository contains TeX files for results and conjectures made by
the Brill-Noether graph theory SUMRY team (Lou Gaudet, Nick Wawrykow,
Teddy Weisman).

This part of the project focuses on determining which finite abelian
groups with pairing appear as the Jacobians of graphs. We explored
both simple graphs and multigraphs throughout the project.
