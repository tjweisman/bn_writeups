Lou's comments on the writeup draft
===========

-- in Lemma 1.6 (having a path of 2-valent vertices gives a bound on mu), might we want to be more careful about how we define what the path P is? (i.e., maybe not define it just in terms of vertices...)

-- after the statement of Theorem 1.9, what is the following paragraph achieving exactly? It looks like it's giving outlining a bit of the structure of the argument that will follow. Is it effective at doing this? Should it be more detailed? Do we need it at all? Should it mention how Theorem 1.8 is proved along the way, and then how it's used at the beginning of the induction that completes the proof of Theorem 1.9?

-- in Definition 1.10, maybe we want to write the definitions of mu and delta in mathematical notation rather than in words

-- just before Lemma 1.14, it says ``Throughout the following, we will suppose that G is a biconnected graph...'' Instead of just establishing this here, I think we should just say it in the statement of each result that follows (where it applies). I think that (although it may sacrifice the slickness of the statements of these things) it's necessary to be more transparent about exactly when we are assuming that G is biconnected

-- notational issue: if we want to consistently use v_0 for a base vertex, then we shouldn't use v_0 and k_0 for integers in the statements of Theorem 1.9 and Proposition 1.15

-- just before Theorem 1.16, the previous paragraph states that ``Lemma 1.1'' (which should be changed accordingly---to Corollary 1.2 I think) implies that ``any graph G may be uniquely associated to some 2-edge-connected graph with identical Jacobian.'' This is technically not correct: Corollary 1.2 technically only implies that G can be considered to be leaf-less, but you need that G is also bridge-less to be 2-edge-connected

-- important! we should really pick a more clearly consistent notation for elements of the Jacobian: for a divisor D, should it be \overline{D}? or [D]?
