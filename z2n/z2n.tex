\begin{prop}
  Let $G$ be a simple graph. Then $\Jac(G)$ cannot be isomorphic to
  $(\Z/2\Z)^n$ for any $n \ge 1$. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Let $G$ be a graph with Jacobian as above, with vertices $V(G)$ and
  edge set $E(G)$.  Since the Jacobian is nontrivial, $G$ must contain
  at least one cycle $C$. Let the vertex and edge sets of this cycle
  be $V(C)$ and $E(C)$, respectively.

  Suppose that there exists $v_1, v_2 \in V(C)$ such that there is a
  path $P$ between $v_1$ and $v_2$ that contains edges in $E(G)
  \setminus E(C)$.  WLOG, all of the edges in $P$ belong to $E(G)
  \setminus E(C)$.

  Let $D \in \Div(G)$ be equal to $v_1 - v_2$. By applying Dhar's
  burning algorithm to $2D$, starting at $v_2$, it can be seen that
  $2D$ is not equivalent to the zero divisor, and hence $[D]$ does not
  have order $2$ as an element of $\Jac(G)$. Thus, no such path $P$
  can exist.

  As a consequence, for any $w \in V(G) \setminus V(C)$, there is a
  unique $v \in V(C)$ such that $v,w$ are path-connected via edges in
  $E(G) \setminus E(C)$. For each $v \in V(C)$, let $H(v) \subset
  V(G)$ be subset of vertices in $V(G) \setminus V(C)$ connected to
  $v$ via edges in $E(G) \setminus E(C)$. 

  The induced subgraph $H_G(v)$ on $H(v) \cup \{v\}$ must be
  connected, and is adjoined to $C$ at the vertex $v$. Since...
