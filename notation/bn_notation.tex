\begin{itemize}
\item $G$ for a graph
\item \emph{biconnected} (instead of 2-vertex-connected) to mean that if you remove any one vertex and its incident edges, resulting graph is still connected
\item for specific graphs:
\begin{itemize}
\item $C_n$ for the $n$-cycle ($n$ vertices, $n$ edges)
\item $B_e$ for the banana with $e$ edges
\item $B_S$ for the subdivided banana corresponding to the multiset $S$ (see below)
\item $C_S$ for the cycle with extra edges corresponding to the multiset $S$ (see below)
\end{itemize}

\item $S=\{s_1,\dots,s_m\}$ for a multiset of integers, $s_i\ge1$ for all $i$
\begin{itemize}
\item given $S$ as above, define $P(S)=\prod_{i=1}^ms_i$
\item given $S$ as above, define $R(S)=\sum_{i=1}^mP(S)/s_i=\sum_{i=1}^ms_1\cdots\widehat{s_i}\cdots s_m$, where the hat indicates omitting that number from the sum
\end{itemize}

\item $V(G)$ for the vertex set of $G$
\item $E(G)$ for the edge (multi)set of $G$
\item $g=g(G)=|E(G)|-|V(G)|+1$ for the genus of $G$
\item $n=|V(G)|$, the number of vertices
\item $e=|E(G)|$, the number of edges
\item $\delta=\delta(G)$, the maximum degree of a vertex in $G$
\item $u,v,w$ for specific vertices
\item $\val(v)$ for the valency\footnote{we specifically don't use the word ``degree'' here to avoid confusion with the degree of a divisor} of the vertex $v$
\item ``naught'' subscript, say $v_0$, for a basepoint

\item $D,E,F$ for divisors
\item $\deg(D)$ for the degree of the divisor $D$
\item $\Div(G)$ for the abelian group of divisors on $G$
\item $\Div^d(G)$ for the coset of divisors of degree $d$ on $G$
\item $\Delta$ for the Laplacian map
\item $\sim$ for equivalence modulo $\im\Delta$ (chip-firing equivalence)
\item $[D]$ for a divisor class under $\sim$
\item $\Jac(G)$ for the Jacobian group of $G$
\item $\mu=\mu(G)$ is the maximum order of an element in $\Jac(G)$

\item $k$ for powers of groups
\item $r$ for powers of primes
\item mathcal capitals for (isomorphism classes of) groups with pairing ($\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}$, etc.)

\end{itemize}
