{\textcolor{purple}{\large{\bf{Divisors on a graph}}}} \vspace{0.05in}\\
Let $G$ be a finite, connected multigraph with no loop edges. Let $V(G),E(G)$ be the vertex and edge sets of $G$.

\begin{itemize}
\item a \textbf{divisor} is an element of $\Div(G)=\bigoplus_{v\in V(G)}\Z(v)$, the free abelian group generated by $V(G)$
\end{itemize}
We think of divisors as ``configurations of chips'' on the vertices of $G$, with group structure given by pointwise addition:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

\end{center}

{\textcolor{purple}{\large{\bf{Chip-firing}}}} \vspace{0.05in}\\
You can ``fire'' a vertex on a divisor to get a new divisor:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

%first divisor
\draw (60:1) -- (0,0) -- (0:1) -- (60:1) ;

\draw [fill] (0,0) circle [radius=0.05cm] ;
\draw [fill] (60:1) circle [radius=0.05cm] ;
\draw [fill=red] (0:1) circle [radius=0.05cm] ;

%first divisor labels
\node [right] at (60:1.15) {$\;0$} ;
\node [left] at (-.1,0) {$-2\;$} ;
\node [right] at (0:1.2) {$2$} ;

%fire arrow
\node [shift={(2.6cm,-.5cm)}] at (0,1) {$\xrightarrow{\hspace{1.5cm}}$} ;
\node [above,shift={(2.6cm,-.5cm)}] at (0,1.15) {fire\;\;\;\;} ;
\draw [fill=red,shift={(2.9cm,1cm)}] (0,-.25) circle [radius=0.05cm] ;

%second divisor
\draw [shift={(4cm,0cm)}] (60:1) -- (0,0) -- (0:1) -- (60:1) ;

\draw [fill,shift={(4cm,0cm)}] (0,0) circle [radius=0.05cm] ;
\draw [fill,shift={(4cm,0cm)}] (60:1) circle [radius=0.05cm] ;
\draw [fill,shift={(4cm,0cm)}] (0:1) circle [radius=0.05cm] ;

%second divisor labels
\node [right,shift={(4cm,0cm)}] at (60:1.15) {$\;1$} ;
\node [left,shift={(4cm,0cm)}] at (-.1,0) {$-1\;$} ;
\node [right,shift={(4cm,0cm)}] at (0:1.2) {$0$} ;

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

If you can get between two divisors $D$ and $D'$ via a sequence of chip-firing moves, then $D,D'$ are equivalent, $D\sim D'$.

\vspace{0.1in}

{\textcolor{purple}{\large{\bf{The Jacobian group}}}}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\deg(D)=$ the total number of chips in $D$
\item $\Div^0(G)=\{D\in\Div(G):\deg(D)=0\}$
\end{itemize}
Now we define the \textbf{Jacobian} group of the graph $G$:
\[
\Jac(G) = \Div^0(G)/\sim.
\]
For a finite graph $G$, $\Jac(G)$ is a finite abelian group.

\begin{fact*}
$|\Jac(G)|=$ the number of spanning trees of $G$.
\end{fact*}
This fact is a consequence of the Matrix Tree Theorem.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Given a finite abelian group $\Gamma$, a \textbf{pairing} on $\Gamma$ is an inner-product like structure $\pair{\cdot}{\cdot}:\Gamma\times\Gamma \to \Q/\Z$ that is \emph{symmetric}, \emph{bilinear}, and \emph{non-degenerate}.

\vspace{0.165in}

{\textcolor{purple}{\large{\bf{Orthogonal sum}}}} \vspace{0.05in}\\
Given two groups $\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2$ with pairings $\pair{\cdot}{\cdot}_1,\pair{\cdot}{\cdot}_2$, the \textbf{orthogonal sum} is a natural pairing defined on $\Gamma_1\times\Gamma_2$ by
\[
\pair{(a_1,a_2)}{(b_1,b_2)}=\pair{a_1}{b_1}_1+\pair{a_2}{b_2}_2.

If $p$ is an odd prime, then, up to isomorphism, there are precisely two pairings on $\Z/p^r\Z$. Written additively, they are given by
\vspace{-0.15in}
\[
\pair{x}{y}=xy/p^r \quad \text{and} \quad \pair{x}{y}=axy/p^r,

{\textcolor{purple}{\large{\bf{Classification theorem}}}} \vspace{0.05in}\\
Given any pairing on any finite abelian group of \emph{odd} order, we can write it as the orthogonal sum of pairings on $\Z/p^r\Z$ terms.

\begin{multicols}{2}

Given a graph $G$, $\Jac(G)$ is endowed with a canonical pairing called the \textbf{monodromy pairing}. Thus it is natural to ask:

\begin{quest*}
Which groups with pairing appear as the Jacobians of finite graphs?
\end{quest*}

Because of the classification theorem above, it suffices to find graphs with $\Jac(G)\simeq \Z/p^r\Z$ and with each of the two pairing isomorphism classes as listed above.

\vspace{0.1in}
{\textcolor{purple}{\large{\bf{The residue pairing}}}} \vspace{0.05in}\\
Consider $B_{p^r}$, the \textbf{banana graph} on $p^r$ edges:

%r pairing for all p
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]

\draw (0,0) to [out=330,in=210] (6,0) ;
\draw (0,0) to [out=345,in=195] (6,0) ;
\draw (0,0) to [out=15,in=165] (6,0) ;
\draw (0,0) to [out=30,in=150] (6,0) ;

\node [right] at (2.95,.25) {$\vdots$} ;

\draw [fill=green] (6,0) circle [radius=0.1cm] ;
\node [right] at (6.1,0) {$\;0$} ;
\draw [fill=green] (0,0) circle [radius=0.1cm] ;
\node [left] at (-.3,0) {$\;1$} ;

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

For every $p$ and $r$, $\Jac(B_{p^r})\simeq\Z/p^r\Z$, and the pairing on $\Jac(B_{p^r})$ is isomorphic to the residue pairing.

\vspace{0.1in}
{\textcolor{purple}{\large{\bf{The nonresidue pairing}}}} \vspace{0.05in}\\
A candidate for getting the nonresidue pairing is the \textbf{cycle graph} $C_{p^r}$. Indeed $\Jac(C_{p^r})=\Z/p^r\Z$, and the pairing is isomorphic to $\pair{x}{y}=(-1)xy/p^r$.

However, it is not true that $-1$ is always a nonresidue modulo $p^r$. This is only true when $p\equiv 3\pmod 4$, so we must consider another construction when $p\equiv 1\pmod 4$. For this, the following claim is sufficient. 

\begin{claim*}
There exists $q$, a nonresidue mod $p$, such that $q^2<p^r$ and $q\equiv 3\pmod 4$ if $r$ is odd and $q\equiv 1\pmod 4$ if $r$ is even.
\end{claim*}
Given this claim, we pick $m$ such that $p^r\equiv m(q-m)\pmod q$, and construct the following \textbf{subdivided banana graph}:

This construction gives us the nonresidue pairing on $\Z/p^r\Z$ with $p\equiv 1\pmod 4$, provided that the above claim holds. For $r\ge2$, we have a proof of this claim. In the case that $r=1$, the \textbf{Generalized Riemann Hypothesis} implies the result.
