Previous investigations were number theoretic, involving continued fractions, and were limited to results on existence and, in some cases, the mean.

\ \ By recasting as a combinatorial problem and using generating functions and differentiating identities, we surmount the limitations inherent in the previous approaches.

\ \ We take the case of Fibonacci numbers as an example to show how our approach works.

\ \ Let $p(n,k)=$ \# $\{N\in [F_n, F_{n+1}):N$ has a $k$-summand
Zeckendorf decomposition$\}$ and $K$ be the random variable associated with $k$ with probability density $p(n,k)$.


\begin{list}{\labelitemi}{\leftmargin=1em}

\vspace{-0.1in}

\item {{\textcolor{blue}{\bf{Recurrence relation}}}}:\\
$p(n+1,k+1)=p(n,k+1)+p(n,k)$.

\vspace{-0.02in}

\item {{\textcolor{blue}{\bf{Generating function}}}}: \\
$\sum_{n,k>0}p(n,k)x^ky^n =\frac{y}{1-y-xy^2}$.

\vspace{-0.02in}

\item {{\textcolor{blue}{\bf{Partial fraction expansion}}}}: \\
$\frac{y}{1-y-xy^2} =\frac{y}{y_2(x)-y_1(x)}\left[\frac{1}{y-y_1(x)}-\frac{1}{y-y_2(x)}\right]$

where $y_1(x)$ and $y_2(x)$ are the roots of\\
$1-y-xy^2=0$.

{\bf{Coefficient of $y^n$}}: \\
$g(x)=\sum_{n,k>0}p(n,k)x^k$.

\vspace{-0.02in}

\item {{\textcolor{blue}{\bf{Differentiating identities}}}}: \\
$g(1)=F_{n+1}-F_n$,  $g'(1)=g(1)E[K]$,

$\left(xg'(x)\right)'|_{x=1}=g(1)E[K^2]$,

$\left(x\left(xg'(x)\right)'\right)'|_{x=1}=g(1)E[K^3]$, ...

Similar results hold for the random variable $K-E[K]$, namely the centralized $K$.

\vspace{-0.02in}

\item {{\textcolor{blue}{\bf{Method of moments}}}}: \\
$E[(K')^{2m}]/E[K'^2]\rightarrow (2m-1)!!$,

$E[(K')^{2m-1}]/E[K'^2]\rightarrow 0$.
