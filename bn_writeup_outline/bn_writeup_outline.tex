\section{Jacobians of finite graphs}

\subsection{Definitions and previous results}

\begin{enumerate}
\item definition of divisors
\item definition of functions on graphs
\item definition of the Laplacian map
\item definition of the Jacobian (cokernel of Laplacian, invariant
factors)
\item Dhar's burning algorithm
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results}

\begin{enumerate}
\item the Jacobian of a wedge sum is the direct product of the
Jacobians

\item Jacobians of basic graphs (cycles, bananas, complete graphs,
etc.)

\item can get all possible groups as Jacobians of multigraphs (via
wedging bananas)

\item define $\mu$, the maximum order of an element in the Jacobian of
a graph (or equivalently the largest invariant factor of the Jacobian)

\item if the multigraph $G$ is biconnected, then $\delta\le\mu$, where
$\delta$ is the maximum degree of a vertex in $G$

\item further, if $G$ is not a banana, then $\delta\le\mu-1$

\item as a corollary, we get a lower bound on $|V(G)|$ in terms of
$\mu$ and $g$

\item can't get $(\Z/2\Z)^n$, $n\ge1$ as the Jacobian of a simple
graph

\item can get $(\Z/3\Z)^n$, $n\ge1$ only by wedging 3-cycles and
3-bananas

\item number of invariant factors in the Jacobian is bounded by the
genus

\item if $G$ is biconnected and has a path $P$ of length $\ell$ and
every vertex in $P$ (besides the endpoints) has valency 2, then
$\Jac(G)$ has an element of order at least $\ell$

\item if $\delta$ is bounded, $|V(G)|$ is bounded by the number of
vertices with valency at least 3

\item if $G$ is biconnected and $\Jac(G)\simeq(\Z/2\Z)^k\times H$,
then there are at most $|H|$ vertices of valency at least 3

\item if the Jacobian of a simple biconnected graph is $(\Z/2\Z)^k
\times H$, then $k$ is bounded by a function of $H$

\item inducting on the number of elementary divisors of $H$, we get a
similar result to the previous one except the graph is not necessarily
biconnected
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Conjectures}

\begin{enumerate}
\item For the $(\Z/2\Z)^k\times H$ thing, can we get a better bound on
$k$?

\item Suppose $G$ is biconnected. Then there is $k_0$ such that
$k>k_0$ implies $\Jac(G)\not\simeq(\Z/n\Z)^k$.

\item Suppose $G$ is biconnected and simple with genus $g$. Then there
exists a constant $c$ such that $\mu\le c\sqrt{g}$ (maybe even
$c=1$). (Because we're thinking along the lines of the complete graph
being worst in this respect.)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Relationship to Jacobians of metric graphs}

\begin{itemize}

\item define an $m$-subdivision

\item if $G\mapsto G'$ from an $m$-subdivision, then we have a result
of what $\Jac(G')$ is

\item conjecture about ``un-subdivisions'': if you have maximal
$m$-torsion with respect to the genus, then you're actually the
$m$-subdivision of another graph

\item the Jacobian of a finite graph has a natural embedding in the
Jacobian of some metric graph

\item think about this as a lattice in a torus, or something of that
nature
\end{itemize}

\section{The monodromy pairing on the Jacobian}

\subsection{Definitions and previous results}

\begin{enumerate}

\item definition of a pairing, definition of the monodromy pairing

\item state classification theorem of groups with pairing

\item Note: from here on out, always think of ``group'' as meaning
  ``group with pairing'' (and isomorphism as isomorphism of groups
  with pairings, etc.)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Jacobian with pairing of a wedge is the orthogonal sum of the
Jacobians with their respective pairings

\item pairings of basic graphs (subdivided bananas, cycles with extra
edges)

\item For any prime $p$ and $r>1$, there exist decompositions of $p^r$
  into symmetric polynomials of $c_1, \ldots, c_k$ such that we can
  get $\prod c_i$ as either a residue or nonresidue mod $p$.

\item if $r>1$, $p$ any odd prime, and $\Gamma$ is any group with
pairing isomorphic to $\Z/p^r\Z$; then there exists a multigraph $G$
with $\Jac(G)\simeq \Gamma$

\item remark: with GRH, we can get the above claims for $r=1$ as well.

\item if the order of $\Gamma$ is odd (and we have GRH), then there
exists a multigraph $G$ with $\Jac(G) \simeq \Gamma$.

\item lemma: if $a\equiv b\pmod 8$, then $axy/2^r$ and $bxy/2^r$ are
isomorphic pairings on $\Z/2^r\Z$

\item for each of the $A,B,C,D$ pairings on $\Z/2^r\Z$ (for any
$r\ge1$), there's a graph $G$ that has Jacobian with pairing
isomorphic to the desired group with pairing

\item $E_2$ is not a Jacobian with pairing for any multigraph

\item if $G$ is simple, cannot get all pairings on $(\Z/3\Z)^n$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Conjectures}

\begin{enumerate}

\item for any $r\ge1$, $E_{2^r}$ is not the Jacobian of any multigraph

\item Note: however, can get some $E_{2^r}$ pairings as subgroups with
pairing given by restricting the monodromy pairing to certain divisor
classes
\end{enumerate}
