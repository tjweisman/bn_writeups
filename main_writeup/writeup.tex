\section{Jacobians of Finite Graphs}
\label{sec:jacobians}

\subsection{The general graph case}
We begin with a result on the structure of the Jacobian of the wedge
sum of two graphs.

\begin{prop}\cite[Proposition 1.2]{CR2000}
\label{prop:wedge_product}
Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be graphs. Then $\Jac(G_1 \vee G_2) \simeq
\Jac(G_1) \times \Jac(G_2)$.
\end{prop}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{tikzpicture}    
    \draw {(0:1) -- (120:1) -- (240:1)} -- cycle (270:1.2) node[below]
    {$G_1$};
    \foreach \theta in {0, 120, 240} {
      \fill (\theta:1) circle (2pt) ;
    } ;

    \node at (0:1.5) {\LARGE $\vee$};

    \begin{scope}[xshift=3cm]
      \draw {(0:1) -- (90:1) -- (180:1) -- (270:1)} -- cycle (270:1.2)
      node[below] {$G_2$};

      \foreach \theta in {0, 90, ...,  270} {
        \fill (\theta:1) circle (2pt) ;
      } ;
    \end{scope}

    \node at (0:4.7) {\LARGE $=$} ;

    \begin{scope}[xshift=6cm]
      \draw {(0:1) -- (120:1) -- (240:1)} -- cycle ;
      \foreach \theta in {0, 120, 240} {
        \fill (\theta:1) circle (2pt) ;
      } ;
      \begin{scope}[xshift=2cm]
        \draw {(0:1) -- (90:1) -- (180:1) -- (270:1)} -- cycle ;
        
        \foreach \theta in {0, 90, ...,  270} {
          \fill (\theta:1) circle (2pt) ;
        } ;
      \end{scope}
      \node[below] at (1,-1.2) {$G_1 \vee G_2$} ;
    \end{scope}
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The wedge sum operation on graphs. In this case, $\Jac(G_1)
  \simeq \Z/3\Z$, $\Jac(G_2) \simeq \Z/4\Z$, and $\Jac(G_1 \vee G_2)
  \simeq \Z/12\Z$.}
\end{figure}

Note that in the case that $G_1$ is a tree (and therefore $\Jac(G_1)$
is trivial), $\Jac(G_1 \vee G_2) \simeq \Jac(G_2)$. We prove the
following corollary:
\begin{cor}
  \label{cor:1_valent}
  Let $G$ be a graph, and let $A = \{v \in V(G) : \val(v) > 1\}$. If
  $G'$ is the subgraph of $G$ induced by $A$, then $\Jac(G) \simeq
  \Jac(G')$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
  Any vertex of valency $1$ can be viewed as a tree of two vertices
  that has been added to the graph via the wedge sum operation. Such
  trees, as noted above, have no effect on the Jacobian of $G$.
\end{proof}

Cori and Rossin noted that Proposition \ref{prop:wedge_product},
together with the classification theorem for finite abelian groups,
tells us that if (for given $n \in \N$) there exists a graph $G$ such
that $\Jac(G)$ is cyclic of order $n$, then \emph{all} finite abelian
groups are the Jacobian of some graph. Cori and Rossin used cycle
graphs to realize these Jacobians; below, we explicitly show that this
construction is valid.

\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:2valent_path}
  Let $G$ be a graph, and suppose that for some path $P$ with vertices
  $\{v_1, \ldots, v_\ell\}$ on $G$, $\val(v_i) = 2$ for all $1 < i <
  \ell$. If $D$ is the divisor $(v_2) - (v_1)$, then, for any $1 < m <
  \ell$,
  \begin{equation*}
    mD \sim (v_{m+1}) - (v_1)
  \end{equation*}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  We can give an explicit sequence of chip-firing moves that shows
  that this equivalence holds: for each $1 < i \le m$, fire the vertex
  $v_i$ $m + 1 - i$ times. We may check that $mD(v_i) = 0$ for all $1
  < i < m+1$ and $mD(v_1) = -1$, $mD(v_{m+1}) = 1$, as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
  \label{cor:2valent_path}
  Let $G$ be any biconnected graph that contains a path $P$ as
  above. Then $\Jac(G)$ contains an element of order at least $\ell$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
  Let $m < \ell$, and consider $D = (v_2) - (v_1)$. $G$ is
  biconnected, so there is a path from $v_1$ to $v_{m+1}$ that does
  not contain any vertex $v_i$ for $1 < i < m$. Applying the burning
  algorithm then shows that the divisor $(v_{m+1}) - (v_1)$ is
  $v_1$-reduced, and hence $m\overline{D}$ is nonzero for $m < \ell$,
  as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
  \label{prop:cycle_cyclic}
  Let $C_n$ be the cycle graph on $n \ge 2$ vertices. Then $\Jac(C_n) \simeq
  \Z/n\Z$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
$C_n$ has $n$ spanning trees, so $|\Jac(C_n)|=n$ and, as before, it
suffices to find a single element of $\Jac(C_n)$ of order at least
$n$. Corollary \ref{cor:2valent_path} guarantees that such an element
exists.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\cite[Corollary 1.3]{CR2000}
  For any finite abelian group $\Gamma$, there exists a graph $G$ such
  that $\Jac(G) \simeq \Gamma$. 
\end{cor}

We will also introduce a family of graphs related to cycle graphs,
which we may also use to realize cyclic Jacobians for any given $n$.

\begin{defn}
  $B_n$, the \emph{banana graph on $n$ edges}, is the graph with
  $V(B_n) = \{v_1, v_2\}$ and edge multiset consisting of $n$ copies of
  $\{v_1, v_2\}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (0,0) to [out=30, in=150] (6,0) ;
      \draw (0,0) to [out=-30, in=-150] (6,0) ;
      \draw (0,0) to [out=0, in=180] (6,0) ;

      \draw [fill] (0,0) circle [radius=.1cm] ;
      \draw [fill] (6,0) circle [radius=.1cm] ;      
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{The $3$-banana $B_3$}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

To find the Jacobian of the banana graph $B_n$, we apply the following
result:

\begin{thm}\cite[Theorem 2]{CR2000}
  \label{thm:graph_dual_iso}
  Let $G$ be a planar graph. For any planar dual $G^\star$ of $G$,
  $\Jac(G) \simeq \Jac(G^\star)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{prop}
  \label{prop:banana_cyclic}
  The Jacobian of $B_n$ is isomorphic to $\Z/n\Z$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  Note that $B_n$ is planar and dual to the cycle graph $C_n$, which
  gives the required result.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The simple graph case}
We have shown that all finite abelian groups appear as the Jacobian of
some graph, which can be constructed using either cycle graphs or
banana graphs. In fact, in many cases, the graphs we construct can be
simple, as $C_n$ is simple whenever $n > 2$:

\begin{prop}
  Let $\Gamma$ be a finite abelian group that is not isomorphic to
  $\Z/2\Z \times H$ for any group $H$ of even order. Then there exists
  a simple graph $G$ such that $\Gamma \simeq \Jac(G)$.
\end{prop}

The rest of this section will investigate which groups $\Gamma =
\Z/2\Z \times H$ can possibly occur as the Jacobian of some simple
graph. It is known that there is no simple graph $G$ with $\Jac(G)
\simeq \Z/2\Z$, since there is no simple graph with two spanning
trees. 

We will generalize this result, first restricting ourselves to the
case that the graph $G$ is biconnected.

\begin{remark}
  \label{remark:biconnected_wedge}
  We motivate this restriction by noting that there is a sense in
  which biconnected graphs generate all other graphs: when $G$ is not
  biconnected, then by definition, there is a vertex $v_0$ such that
  the subgraph $G'$ induced by $V(G) \setminus \{v_0\}$ is not
  connected. $G$ is then the wedge sum of the connected components of
  $G'$ (each taken together with the vertex $v_0$), and so $\Jac(G)$
  splits as a direct product of Jacobians of subgraphs of $G$.
\end{remark}

\begin{defn}
  Let $G$ be a graph. We will write $\mu(G)$ for the maximum order of
  an element of $\Jac(G)$, and $\delta(G)$ for the maximum valency of
  a vertex in $G$. (When the graph $G$ is clear from context, we will
  simply write $\delta$ or $\mu$).
\end{defn}

\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:delta_le_mu}
  If $G$ is biconnected, then $\delta(G) \le \mu(G)$. Furthermore, if
  $\delta(G) = \mu(G)$, then $G$ must be the banana graph $B_\mu$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $v$ be a vertex in $V(G)$ with valency $\delta$, and let $w$ be
  a vertex adjacent to $v$. Consider the divisor $D = (v) -
  (w)$, and let $m < \delta$ be a positive integer. 

  We apply Dhar's burning algorithm to check that $mD$ is
  $w$-reduced. Since $G$ is biconnected, there is a path from $w$ to
  each of the neighbors of $v$ that does not contain $v$, and so each
  of the neighbors of $v$ is burned during the algorithm. $v$ has more
  than $m$ distinct neighbors, so it is burned as well. Therefore,
  $m\overline{D}$ is nonzero and $\overline{D}$ has order at least
  $\delta$.

  In the case that $\delta = \mu$, we must have $\delta\overline{D} =
  0$. Starting from $\delta D$, chip-fire $v$ once to obtain some
  divisor $E$. Applying the burning algorithm and the biconnectivity
  condition once more, we see that $v$, as well as each of its
  neighbors, must be burned, so that $E$ is $w$-reduced. $E$ must be
  the zero divisor, which is only possible if the multiplicity of the
  edge $\{v,w\}$ is $\delta$, i.e. $G$ is a banana graph.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
  \label{cor:genus_v_mu}
  For any biconnected graph with genus $g$ and $|V(G)| = n$,
  \begin{equation*}
    n \ge \frac{2g - 2}{\mu - 2}.
  \end{equation*}
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
  Let $e = |E(G)|$. We have 
  \begin{equation*}
    2e = \sum_{i=1}^n \val(v_i) \le \sum_{i=1}^n \delta = n \cdot \delta
    \le n \cdot \mu.
  \end{equation*}
  Since $e = g + n - 1$, this gives $2g - 2 \le n \cdot (\mu - 2)$, as
  required.
\end{proof}

We now prove the first of our main results:

\begin{thm}
  \label{thm:2group}
  For any $k \ge 1$, there is no simple graph $G$ such that $\Jac(G)
  \simeq (\Z/2\Z)^k$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Let $G$ be a biconnected graph with $\Jac(G) = (\Z/2\Z)^k$. By
  Corollary \ref{cor:1_valent}, we may assume without loss of
  generality that each vertex of $G$ has valency at least $2$. By
  Lemma \ref{lem:delta_le_mu}, each vertex of $G$ has valency exactly
  $2$, hence $G = C_n$ for some $n$. We must have $n=2$, which means
  $G$ cannot be simple.

  Now let $G$ be a graph that is \emph{not} biconnected, with $\Jac(G)
  \simeq (\Z/2\Z)^k$. We proceed by induction on $k$.
  
  The base case $k=1$ is known. For $k > 1$, note that $\Jac(G) \simeq
  \Jac(G_1) \times \Jac(G_2)$ for connected subgraphs $G_1, G_2$ of
  $G$ (see Remark \ref{remark:biconnected_wedge}). Without loss of
  generality, $G_2$ is not a tree, and hence $\Jac(G_1) \simeq
  (\Z/2\Z)^{k_1}$ for $k_1 < k$. By the inductive hypothesis, $G_1$ is
  not simple, and so neither is $G$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  \label{remark:2group_characterize}
  The proof of Theorem \ref{thm:2group} also gives a complete
  characterization of any graph $G$ with $\Jac(G) \simeq
  (\Z/2\Z)^k$. In general, we can always obtain $G$ by the following
  procedure: starting with some tree $T$, choose $k$ edges of $T$, and
  give those edges multiplicity $2$. We will apply this
  characterization later, in our discussion of the monodromy pairing
  on $\Jac(G)$.
\end{remark}

    \caption{An example of a graph $G$ with $\Jac(G) \simeq
      (\Z/2\Z)^6$}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

We will now generalize Theorem \ref{thm:2group} to graphs whose
Jacobian is of the form $(\Z/2\Z)^k \times H$, using a similar
inductive argument on biconnected subgraphs. Throughout the following,
we will suppose that $G$ is a biconnected graph with Jacobian $\Jac(G)
= \Gamma \simeq (\Z/2\Z)^k \times H$ for some finite abelian group
$H$, and that $\mu$ is the maximum order of an element of $H$. We will
require the following bound on the genus of $G$, which is stated as
Proposition 5.2 in \cite{Lorenzini1989}. 

\begin{prop}[Lorenzini, 1989]
  \label{prop:genus_cycle}
  If $g$ is the genus of $G$, then $g \ge k$.
\end{prop}

Applying Corollary \ref{cor:genus_v_mu} to this result shows that 
\begin{equation*}
  |V(G)| \ge \frac{2k-2}{\mu - 2}
\end{equation*}
We now establish an upper bound on $|V(G)|$ in terms of $\mu$ and
$|H|$, to achieve an upper bound on $k$.

\begin{prop}
  \label{prop:v_bound}
  Suppose that $G$ is biconnected. Then for any finite abelian group
  $H$, there exists an integer $n_H$ such that if $\Gamma = \Jac(G)
  \simeq (\Z/2\Z)^k \times H$, then $|V(G)| < n_H$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  Let $U = \{u \in V(G) : \val(u) > 2\}$, and enumerate the elements
  of $U$ as $u_1, \ldots, u_m$. We will first establish a bound on
  $m = |U|$, and then bound $|V(G)|$ in terms of $m$.
  
  Consider the set of divisors $\mathcal{U} = \{(u_i) - (u_1) : 1 \le
  i \le m\}$, and let $\overline{\mathcal{U}} \subseteq \Gamma$ be the
  set of equivalence classes of the elements of $\mathcal{U}$. Write
  $D_i$ for $(u_i) - (u_1)$. For any $D_i, D_j \in \mathcal{U}$, we
  claim that $2D_j - 2D_i$ is $u_i$-reduced.

  We have $2D_j - 2D_i = 2(u_j) - 2(u_i)$. Since $G$ is biconnected,
  there is a path from $u_i$ to each of the neighbors of $u_j$ that
  does not contain $u_j$. Since $u_j$ has valency at least $3$, in the
  first iteration of the burning algorithm, $u_j$ (and in turn the
  entire graph) will be burned. Therefore $2D_j - 2D_i$ is
  $u_i$-reduced, and $2\overline{D_j} \ne 2\overline{D_i}$ for any $i
  \ne j$. Note that this also implies that $\overline{D_j} \ne
  \overline{D_i}$ for any $i \ne j$, so we have
  $m=|\overline{\mathcal{U}}|$.

  We now define a map
  \begin{align*}
    \phi: \Gamma \to \Gamma \\
    \overline{D} \mapsto 2\overline{D}
  \end{align*}

  By the above, we have
  $|\phi(\overline{\mathcal{U}})|=|\overline{\mathcal{U}}|=m$. Furthermore,
  $|\im(\phi)| \le |H|$, and so we find
  $m=|\phi(\overline{\mathcal{U}})| \le |H|$ as desired.

  We now wish to bound $|V(G)|$ in terms of $m$. To do so, consider a
  graph $G'$, given by the following transformation of $G$:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Choose any vertex of $G$ of valency $2$. Delete it, and draw
    an edge between its neighbors.
  \item Repeat until there are no 2-valent vertices remaining.
  \end{enumerate}

      \end{tikzpicture}
      \caption{The transformation $G \mapsto G'$}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

  Note that even if $G$ is simple, $G'$ need not be. It is clear,
  however, that $G$ and $G'$ have the same number of vertices with
  valency greater than $2$, and that $\delta(G) = \delta(G')$.

  By Lemma \ref{lem:delta_le_mu}, we must have that $e' = |E(G')|$ is
  at most $m \cdot \mu$ (since otherwise there would necessarily be a
  vertex of $G$ with valency greater than $\delta$). Each 2-valent
  vertex of $G$ is uniquely associated with some edge of $G'$. If
  there are more than $e' \cdot \mu$ 2-valent vertices in $G$, then at
  least $\mu$ of them are associated with a single edge of $G'$.

  In this case, $G$ would contain a path $P$ of length greater than
  $\mu$, where each vertex of $P$ has valency $2$. This would
  contradict Corollary \ref{cor:2valent_path}, so instead we have
  \[
  |V(G)| - m < m\mu^2.
  \] 
  Choosing $n_H = |H|(1 + \mu^2)$ then gives $|V(G)| < n_H$, as
  required.
\end{proof}

Applying Corollary \ref{cor:genus_v_mu} and Proposition
\ref{prop:genus_cycle}, we see that for sufficiently large $k$, we
must have $|V(G)| > n_H$. This in turn implies that for sufficiently
large $k$, $(\Z/2\Z)^k \times H$ is not the Jacobian of any
biconnected graph. We will use this fact to show that this result
holds generally, for all simple graphs.

\begin{thm}
  \label{thm:2group_product}
  Let $H$ be a finite abelian group. There exists an integer $k_H$
  such that for all $k > k_H$, there does not exist a simple graph $G$
  with $\Jac(G) \simeq (\Z/2\Z)^k \times H$.
\end{thm}
  
\begin{proof}
  When $|H| = 1$ or $2$, Theorem \ref{thm:2group} gives the bound $k_H
  = 1$. For $|H| \ge 3$, there must exist (by Proposition
  \ref{prop:v_bound}) an integer $k'$ such that if $k > k'$, and
  $\Jac(G) \simeq (\Z/2\Z)^k \times H$, then $G$ is not biconnected.

  We proceed by induction on $|H|$. By the inductive hypothesis, for
  any proper subgroup $H' \subset H$, there exists an integer $k(H')$
  such that for all $k > k(H')$, no simple graph $G'$ has $\Jac(G')
  \simeq (\Z/2\Z)^k \times H'$. Now, since $H$ is finite, there are
  finitely many pairs of nontrivial proper subgroups $H_1, H_2 \subset
  H$ such that $H_1 \times H_2 \simeq H$. Define

\begin{equation*}
  k'' = \max\{k(H_1) + k(H_2) : H_1, H_2 \textrm{ nontrivial}, H_1
  \times H_2 \simeq H\}
\end{equation*}

Now let $k_H = \max(k', k'')$. We wish to show that for all $k > k_H$,
if $\Jac(G) \simeq (\Z/2\Z)^k \times H$, then $G$ is not simple. Let
$G$ be a graph with this Jacobian, and let $k > k_H$.  Since $k > k'$,
$G$ is not biconnected, so it must be the wedge sum of two graphs
$G_1$ and $G_2$ (see Remark \ref{remark:biconnected_wedge}). There
must then exist integers $k_1, k_2$ with $k_1 + k_2 = k$ and groups
$H_1, H_2$ with $H_1 \times H_2 \simeq H$ such that

\begin{align*}
  \Jac(G_1) &\simeq (\Z/2\Z)^{k_1} \times H_1 \\
  \Jac(G_2) &\simeq (\Z/2\Z)^{k_2} \times H_2
\end{align*}

Without loss of generality, we may assume that neither $G_1$ nor $G_2$
is a tree, so that $\Jac(G_1)$ and $\Jac(G_2)$ are both nontrivial. In
that case, if either $H_1$ or $H_2$ were trivial, then $G_1$
(resp. $G_2$) would have Jacobian isomorphic to $(\Z/2\Z)^k$ for $k >
0$, implying that at least one of $G_1$ or $G_2$ is not simple.

Finally, since $k_1 + k_2 = k > k'' \ge k(H_1) + k(H_2)$, we must have
that either $k_1 > k(H_1)$ or $k_2 > k(H_2)$. Then either $G_1$ or
$G_2$ is not simple, so that $G$ is not simple, as required.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Further queries} 

Analysis of the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:2group_product} suggests
that, if $H \simeq \Z/p^r\Z$ for prime $p$, $k_H = O(|H|p^3)$. In
practice, it seems that much better bounds should hold. For instance,
we were unable to find any simple graph $G$ where $\Jac(G) \simeq
(\Z/2\Z)^k \times H$ for any $k > |H|$.

In some cases, it is possible to directly verify that certain groups
do not arise as the Jacobian of any simple graph. We note that, for
given $m$, while there are infinitely many isomorphism classes of
simple graphs with fewer than $m$ spanning trees, at most finitely
many of these classes represent 2-edge-connected graphs. This results
from the fact that, for any vertex $v_0$ on a 2-edge-connected graph,
any divisor of the form $(v) - (v_0)$ is $v_0$-reduced, and hence
there are at least as many spanning trees on the graph as there are
vertices.  

Lemma \ref{prop:wedge_product} tells us that any graph $G$ may be
uniquely associated to some 2-edge-connected graph with identical
Jacobian, since we may always contract bridges and leaves. For a given
group $H$, it is possible to compute the Jacobian of all
2-edge-connected simple graphs with at most $|H|$ spanning trees, and
verify that $H$ does or does not occur.

Computer searches of this nature have led to the following:

\begin{thm}
  The groups $\Z/2\Z \times \Z/4\Z$, $(\Z/2\Z)^2 \times \Z/4\Z$, and
  $\Z/2\Z \times (\Z/4\Z)^2$ are not isomorphic to the Jacobian of any
  simple graph.
\end{thm}

It is also of interest that the key fact in the proof of the
nonoccurence of groups with many factors of $\Z/2\Z$ seems to be the
requirement that $G$ is biconnected, rather than that $G$ is
simple. It has been shown that, asymptotically, the probability that
the Jacobian of a random graph is cyclic is relatively high (CITE A
THING). We might then expect that the Jacobians of most graphs have a
small number of invariant factors. Since random graphs are almost
always biconnected, we make the following conjecture:

\begin{conj}
  For any $n \in \N$, there exists $k_n$ such that if $k > k_n$, there
  is no biconnected graph $G$ with $\Jac(G) \simeq (\Z/n\Z)^k$.
\end{conj}

We already know that this conjecture holds for $n=3$, as Lemma
\ref{lem:delta_le_mu} shows that the the only biconnected graphs with
Jacobian $(\Z/3\Z)^k$ are the $3$-cycle and the $3$-banana. In this
case, we have $k_3 = 1$.

In addition, we note that when $\Jac(G) \simeq (\Z/n\Z)^k \times H$
for some finite abelian group $H$, $k$ is necessarily bounded above by
the genus of $G$. We will now consider certain circumstances under
which this bound can be achieved, and examine a construction for a
graph that provides it.

\subsection{The Jacobian of a subdivided graph}

For any graph $G$ with genus $g$, let $G'$ be the metric graph
obtained by giving each edge of $G$ length $1$. It is known that
$\Jac(G)$ is a finite subgroup of $\Jac(G')$, corresponding to a
sublattice of $(\R/\Z)^g$ (CITE PLEASE).

Let $G_m$ be the graph obtained by ``subdividing'' the edges of $G$
$m$ times; that is, we add $m-1$ two-valent vertices to $V(G)$ for
each edge of $G$, and replace each edge of $G$ with $m$ edges between
those vertices.

\end{figure}

[CITATION] provides the following result:

\begin{prop}
  \label{prop:quotient_subdivide}
  $\Jac(G)$ is a subgroup of $\Jac(G_m)$, with 
\begin{equation*}
  \Jac(G_m)/\Jac(G) \simeq (\Z/m\Z)^g
\end{equation*}
\end{prop}

Below, we will give an explicit description of the structure of
$\Jac(G')$. We will begin by considering the image of a map
\begin{align*}
  &\phi_m:\Jac(G_m) \to \Jac(G_m)\\
  &D \mapsto mD
\end{align*}

We first show that $\phi_m$ is surjective onto $\Jac(G)$.

\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:m_surjective}
  For each $D \in \Div^0(G)$, $\exists D' \in \Div^0(G_m)$ such that $m
  \cdot D' \sim D$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $A \subseteq \Div^0(G)$ be the set of divisors of the form $(v)
  - (w)$ for $\{v, w\} \in E(G)$. It is clear that the elements of $A$
  generate $\Div^0(G)$, so it suffices to prove the proposition for
  all $D = \in A$.
  
  Let $D \in A$, and write $D = (v_0) - (v_m)$. In $G_m$, $v_0$ and
  $v_m$ are connected by a path of length $m$, where each vertex in
  the path has degree $2$.
  
  Let the vertices in this path be $\{v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_m\}$. Lemma
  \ref{lem:2valent_path} shows that $(v_m) - (v_0)$ is in fact
  equivalent to $m \cdot (v_1) - m \cdot (v_0)$.
\end{proof}

Let $D \in \Div^0(G_m)$ be written $\sum_{i=1}^na_iv_i$, for $a_i \in
\Z$. The proof of Proposition \ref{lem:m_surjective} also
demonstrates that if $a_1 = m$ and $a_j = 0$ for all $j \ne 0, m$,
then $D \sim D'$ for some $D' \in \Jac(G)$. More generally, we can see
that the image of the map $\phi_m$ is contained in $\Jac(G)$, by the
following proposition.

\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:m_to_jac}
  Let $D \in \Div^0(G_m)$ be written $\sum_{i=1}^na_iv_i$, and suppose
  that for each $v_i \in V(G_m) \setminus V(G)$, $m | a_i$. Then $D
  \sim D'$ for some $D' \in \Div^0(G)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  As in Proposition \ref{lem:m_surjective}, enumerate the first $m+1$
  vertices in $G_m$ by letting $v_0, v_m$ be adjacent vertices in $G$,
  and $v_1$ to $v_{m-1}$ be the vertices on the path between them in
  $G_m$. It suffices to prove the proposition for divisors that are
  supported on $V(G) \cup \{v_i\}$ for $1 \le i < m$, with $a_i = m$.

  We proceed by induction on $i$. The case $i=1$ follows directly from
  the proof of Proposition \ref{lem:m_surjective} (the divisor $m
  \cdot v_0 - m \cdot v_1$ is equivalent to $v_0 - v_m \in
  \Div^0(G)$).

  For $i > 1$, it is clear that the divisor $m \cdot v_{i-2} - 2m
  \cdot v_{i-1} + m \cdot v_i$ is equivalent to $0$ (it can be
  obtained by chip-firing $v_{i-1}$ once). By the inductive
  hypothesis, the are divisors $D_1, D_2 \in \Div(G)$ such that $D_1
  + p \cdot v_{i-2} \sim D_1'$ and $D_2 + p \cdot v_{i-1} \sim D_2'$
  for $D_1', D_2' \in \Div^0(G)$.

  We then have $-D_1' + 2D_2' \sim -D_1 + 2D_2 + p \cdot v_i$, so
  $D + p \cdot v_i \sim D'$ for $D \in \Div(G)$, $D' \in \Div^0(G)$,
  as required.
\end{proof}

Together, Lemma \ref{lem:m_surjective} and Lemma \ref{lem:m_to_jac}
show the following:
\begin{cor}
  \label{cor:phi_jac}
  The image of the map $\phi_m$ is precisely the group $\Jac(G)$. 
\end{cor}

\begin{thm}
  \label{thm:subdivide}
  Let $G$ be a graph with genus $g$, and suppose
  \begin{equation*}
    \Jac(G) \simeq \Z/a_1\Z \times \Z/a_2\Z \times \ldots \times \Z/a_k\Z
  \end{equation*}

  such that $a_i > 1$ and $a_{i-1} | a_i$ for all $1 < i \le k$. Let
  $G_m$ be as above. Then

  \begin{equation*}
    \Jac(G_m) \simeq (\Z/m\Z)^{g-k} 
    \times \Z/ma_1\Z \times \ldots \times \Z/ma_k\Z.
  \end{equation*}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  It suffices to prove the theorem for $m=p$ for prime $p$, since we
  may achieve a subdivision into $b_1b_2$ edges by successively
  subdividing into $b_1$ and $b_2$ edges.
  
  Let $B = \{D_1, \ldots, D_k\}$ be a minimal set of generators for
  $\Jac(G)$, so that $|D_i| = a_i$ for $1 \le i \le k$. It follows
  from Corollary \ref{cor:phi_jac} that there is a set $B' \subset
  \Jac(G_p)$, $B' = \{D_1', \ldots D_k'\}$ such that $\phi(D_i') =
  D_i$.

  For each $D_i'$, we must have either $|D_i'| = pa_i$ or $|D_i'| =
  a_i$. If $|D_i'| = a_i$, then $\langle D_i \rangle$ is the same
  invariant factor $\Z/a_i\Z$ of $\Jac(G)$ generated by $p \cdot D_i$,
  and therefore $\gcd(p, a_i) = 1$. If $|D_i'| = pa_i$, then $\langle
  D_i' \rangle \simeq \Z/pa_i\Z$.

  So, if $j$ is the smallest integer such that $\gcd(p, a_i) = 1$ for
  all $i \le j$, then the set $B'$ generates the group

  $$H \simeq \Z/a_1\Z \times \ldots \times \Z/a_j\Z 
  \times \Z/pa_{j+1}\Z \times \ldots \times \Z/pa_k\Z.$$

  Since $\Jac(G)$ is a subgroup of $H$, if $D \in \Jac(G_p)$ is not
  generated by $B$, Proposition \ref{prop:quotient_subdivide} implies
  that $D$ has order $p$. So we have $\Jac(G_p) \simeq H \times
  (\Z/p\Z)^{g-k+j}$, since there are $p^{g-k+j}$ elements in
  $\Jac(G_p)$ not in $H$.

  However, since $a_1, \ldots, a_j$ are each coprime to $p$, we can
  simplify the product of cyclic groups and write

\begin{equation*}
  \Jac(G_p) \simeq \Z/pa_1\Z \times 
  \ldots \times \Z/pa_k\Z \times (\Z/p\Z)^{g-k}
\end{equation*}

as required.
\end{proof}

When $|H|$ is odd, the theorem above shows that, if there exists a
graph $G$ with genus $g$ such that $\Jac(G) \simeq H$, then there also
exists a graph $G'$ such that $\Jac(G') \simeq (\Z/2\Z)^g \times H$.

\section{The monodromy pairing on the Jacobian}


The Jacobian of a finite graph is endowed with a natural pairing,
called the monodromy pairing. Since it is possible to classify all
finite abelian groups with pairing, we will now consider which groups
\emph{with pairing} occur as the Jacobian of some graph.

\begin{note}
  Throughout the rest of this section, unless otherwise noted, we will
  always use the word ``group'' to mean ``group \emph{with pairing},''
  ``isomorphism'' and ``$\simeq$'' to mean an isomorphism of groups
  with pairing, and $\oplus$ to denote the orthogonal sum on groups
  with pairing. For a graph $G$, we will take $\Jac(G)$ to mean the
  Jacobian of $G$ with its associated monodromy pairing.
\end{note}

Our main result will be the following:

\begin{thm}
  \label{thm:graph_pairing}
  Let $\Gamma$ be a finite abelian group of odd order, not isomorphic
  to $(\Z/p\Z) \times H$ for any prime $p \equiv 1 \pmod {24}$ and
  group $H$. Then there exists a graph $G$ such that
  \[
  \Jac(G) \simeq \Gamma.
  \]
\end{thm}

Under the assumption of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, we will be
able to strengthen this result:

\begin{thm}[Conditional on GRH]
  \label{thm:graph_pairing_grh}
  Let $\Gamma$ be a finite abelian group of odd order. Then there
  exists a graph $G$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    \Jac(G) \simeq \Gamma.
  \end{equation*}
\end{thm}

\subsection{Basic constructions}

As in the case of groups without pairing, we will take advantage of
the fact that the wedge sum of two graphs corresponds to a product
operation on the Jacobians of those graphs. In this case, the
``product'' will be the orthogonal sum on groups with pairing, as seen
below:

\begin{prop}
  \label{prop:wedge_sum}
  Let $G_1$, $G_2$ be graphs. Then $\Jac(G_1 \vee G_2) \simeq
  \Jac(G_1) \oplus \Jac(G_2)$. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}

  Fix two graph isomorphisms $\psi_1, \psi_2$ that map $G_1, G_2$ into
  their corresponding subgraphs of $G$ (respectively). Define the map
  $\iota_1: \Div^0(G_1) \hookrightarrow \Div^0(G)$ by
  \[
  \iota_1 \left(\sum_{v \in V(G_1)}a_v v \right)= \sum_{v \in
    V(G_1)}a_{v} \psi(v),
  \]
  and define $\iota_2 : \Div^0(G_2) \hookrightarrow \Div^0(G)$
  analogously.

  Now let $D, E \in \Div^0(G)$ be given; we can uniquely write
  \[
  D = D_1 + D_2 \quad \text{and} \quad E = E_1 + E_2,
  \]
  where $D_1, E_1 \in \im(\iota_1)$ and $D_2, E_2 \in
  \im(\iota_2)$. It suffices to show that
  \[
  \pair{D}{E}_G = \pair{\iota_1^{-1}(D_1)}{\iota_1^{-1}(E_1)}_{G_1} +
  \pair{\iota_2^{-1}(D_2)}{\iota_2^{-1}(E_2)}_{G_2}.
  \]
  Let $m = |\Jac(G)|$, so $m \cdot \iota_1^{-1}(E_1) \in
  \im(\Delta_1)$ and $m \cdot \iota_2^{-1}(E_2) \in
  \im(\Delta_2)$. Now choose $f_1 \in \Delta_1^{-1} (m \cdot
  \iota_1^{-1}(E_1))$ and $f_2 \in \Delta_2^{-1} (m \cdot
  \iota_2^{-1}(E_2))$ such that $f_1(\psi_1^{-1}(v_0)) =
  f_2(\psi_2^{-1}(v_0)) = 0$. We lift these to functions
  $\widehat{f_1}, \widehat{f_2} \in \mathcal{M}(G)$ be defining
  \[
  \widehat{f_1}(v) =
  \begin{cases}
    f_1(\psi_1^{-1}(v)) & \text{if $v \in V(\im(\psi_1))$} \\
    0 & \text{if $v \notin V(\im(\psi_1))$},
  \end{cases}
  \]
  and analogously for $\widehat{f_2}$.

  Now we claim that $\widehat{f_1} \in \Delta^{-1}(mE_1)$ and
  $\widehat{f_2} \in \Delta^{-1}(mE_2)$. We prove this just for
  $\widehat{f_1}$, since the proof for $\widehat{f_2}$ is
  analogous. First, note that $\Delta(\widehat{f_1})(v)=0=mE_1(v)$ for
  all $v \notin V(\im(\psi_1))$. Then note that $\Delta_1(f_1)(u) = m
  \cdot \iota_1^{-1}(E_1)(u)$ for all $u \in V(G_1)$, so by taking
  $\psi_1(u)=v$, we get
  \[
  \Delta_1(f_1)(u) = \Delta_1(f_1)(\psi_1^{-1}(v)) = m \cdot \iota_1^{-1}(E_1)(\psi_1^{-1}(v)) = mE_1(v)
  \]
  for all $u \in V(G_1)$. Now we have
  \begin{align*}
    \Delta_1(f_1)(u) &= \ord_{u}(f_1) = \sum_{\{u,w\} \in E(G_1)} f_1(u) - f_1(w) \\
    &= \sum_{\{\psi_1(u),\psi_1(w)\} \in E(G)}
    \widehat{f_1}(\psi_1(u)) - \widehat{f_1}(\psi_1(w)) =
    \ord_{\psi_1(u)}(\widehat{f_1}) = \Delta(\widehat{f_1})(v),
  \end{align*}
  so we deduce that $\Delta(\widehat{f_1})(v)=mE_1(v)$ for all $v\in
  V(\im(\psi_1))$ as well, and hence
  $\widehat{f_1}\in\Delta^{-1}(mE_1)$, as desired.

  Now by the definition of the monodromy pairing in \cite{Shokrieh2010},
  \begin{align*}
    \pair{D_1}{E_1}_G &= \frac{1}{m} \sum_{v \in V(G)} D_1(v) \widehat{f_1}(v) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{v \in V(\psi_1(G_1))} D_1(v) \widehat{f_1}(v) \\
    &= \frac{1}{m} \sum_{u \in V(G_1)} D_1(\psi_1(u)) \widehat{f_1}(\psi_1(u)) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{u\in V(G_1)} \iota_1^{-1}(D_1)(u)f_1(u) \\
    &= \pair{\iota_1^{-1}(D_1)}{\iota_1^{-1}(E_1)}_{G_1}.
  \end{align*}
  An analogous argument shows that $\pair{D_2}{E_2}_G =
  \pair{\iota_1^{-1}(D_2)}{\iota_1^{-1}(E_2)}_{G_2}$. Further,
  \[
  \pair{D_1}{E_2}_G = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{v \in V(G)} D_1(v)
  \widehat{f_2}(v) = 0,
  \]
  since $\widehat{f_2}(v)=0$ when $v\in V(\im(\psi_1))$ and $D_1(v)=0$
  when $v\notin V(\im(\psi_1))$. An identical argument shows that
  $\pair{D_2}{E_1}_G = 0$. Therefore, by bilinearity,
  \begin{align*}
    \pair{D}{E}_G &= \pair{D_1}{E_1} + \pair{D_1}{E_2} + \pair{D_2}{E_1} + \pair{D_2}{E_2} \\
    &= \pair{\iota_1^{-1}(D_1)}{\iota_1^{-1}(E_1)}_{G_1} + \pair{\iota_2^{-1}(D_2)}{\iota_2^{-1}(E_2)}_{G_2},
  \end{align*}
  as desired.
\end{proof}


The problem is now reduced to the following: given a prime $p$,
positive integers $r$ and $k$, and a pairing $\pair{\cdot}{\cdot}$ on
$(\Z/p^r\Z)^k$, we wish to find graphs $G$ such that $\Jac(G) \simeq
((\Z/p^r\Z)^k, \pair{\cdot}{\cdot})$. In most cases (in particular
when $p$ is odd), we can take $k=1$ and restrict our search to graphs
with cyclic Jacobian.

Section \ref{sec:jacobians} gave a construction for graphs with any
desired Jacobian, but we require a way to construct graphs whose
Jacobian is associated with a particular pairing. We provide two
possible constructions below:

\begin{defn}
  Let $S = \{s_1, \ldots, s_m\}$ be a multiset of positive
  integers. $B_S$, the \emph{subdivided banana graph of $S$}, is the
  graph obtained by subidividing the $i$th edge of $B_m$ by $s_i-1$
  vertices.
\end{defn}

\begin{figure}[H]

       coordinate[pos=0.8] (D) (6,0);

    \draw (0,0) to [out=-30, in=-150] (6,0);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The subdivided banana graph $B_S$, for $S = \{5, 2, 1\}$.}
\end{figure}

\begin{defn}
  Let $S = \{s_1, \ldots, s_m\}$ be a multiset of positive
  integers. $C_S$, the \emph{multicycle graph of $S$}, is the graph
  obtained giving the $i$th edge of $C_m$ multiplicity $s_i$.
\end{defn}

Note that the graphs $B_S$ and $C_S$ are planar duals of each other,
leading to the following (by Theorem \ref{thm:graph_dual_iso}):

\begin{prop}
  \label{prop:banana_cycle_iso}
  For any multiset $S$ of positive integers, $\Jac(B_S) \simeq
  \Jac(C_S)$. 
\end{prop}

\begin{note}
  Throughout this section, we will use the following enumerations on
  the vertices of $B_S$ and $C_S$:

  On $B_S$, let $v_0, v_0'$ be the vertices corresponding to $v_1,
  v_2$ on $B_m$, and let $v_{ij}$ be the $j$th vertex that subdivides
  the $i$th edge of $B_m$.

  On $C_S$, we enumerate the vertices as $v_0, \ldots, v_m$, such
  that that the multiplicity of the edge $\{v_i, v_{i+1}\}$ is $s_i$.
\end{note}

When $|S| = m$, we will use the following notation for the $(m-1)$th
elementary symmetric polynomial applied to the elements of $S$:

\begin{defn}
  Let $S = \{s_1, \ldots, s_m\}$. Define
  \begin{align*}
    R(S) &= \sum_{i=1}^ms_1\ldots\hat{s_i}\ldots s_m 
  \end{align*}
  where $\hat{s_i}$ indicates that $s_i$ is not included in the
  product.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
  \label{prop:banana_pairing}
  Let $S$ be a multiset of positive integers such that $R(S) = p^r$
  for a prime $p$ and integer $r$, and $\gcd(s_i, p) = 1$ for all $s_i
  \in S$. Then
  \begin{equation*}
    \Jac(B_S) \simeq (\Z/p^r\Z, \pair{\cdot}{\cdot}),
  \end{equation*}
  where $\pair{\cdot}{\cdot}$ is the pairing on $\Z/p^r\Z$ given by
  \begin{equation*}
    \pair{x}{y} = \frac{\left(\prod_{i=1}^ms_i\right)xy}{p^r}.
  \end{equation*}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  We first show that $|\Jac(B_S)| = p^r$. Let $|S| = m$. We may
  partition the edges of $B_S$ into sets $E_1, \ldots, E_m$, where
  $E_i$ corresponds to the $i$th edge of the banana graph $B_m$. The
  edge set of any spanning tree on $B_S$ must be

  \begin{equation*}
    E_i \cup \left(\bigcup_{j \ne i} (E_j \setminus \{e_{jk}\})\right),
  \end{equation*}
  where $e_{jk}$ is some edge in $E_j$. Each possible choice of $E_i$
  and $e_{jk}$ corresponds to a distinct spanning tree of $B_S$, so we
  have $R(S)$ spanning trees, as required.

  Now consider the divisor $D = (v_0') - (v_0)$. We claim that
  $m\overline{D}$ is nonzero for any $m < p^r$. Suppose otherwise, so
  that $p^tD$ is principal for $t < r$, and let $\Delta$ be the
  Laplacian map of $G$. There must exist a function $f:V(G) \to \Z$
  such that $\Delta f = D$.

  For each edge $e = \{u, v\} \in E(B_S)$, let $b(e) = f(u) - f(v)$
  (orient each edge to point from $v_{ij}$ to $v_{ij+1}$). Since $D(v)
  = 0$ for any $v \in V(G) \setminus \{v_0, v_0'\}$, we must have
  $b(e_1) = b(e_2)$ for any $e_1, e_2 \in E_i$.  If $a_i = b(e)$ for
  any $e \in E_i$, then the following conditions must both hold:
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item 
      \[
      \sum_{i=0}^m a_i = p^t
      \]
    \item
      \[
      a_is_i = f(v_2) \textrm{ for all } 1 \le i \le m
      \]
  \end{enumerate}

  Taking these conditions together with the fact that $R(S) = p^r$, we
  see
  \begin{equation*}
    p^t = \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{f(v_2)}{s_i^{-1}} = 
    \frac{f(v_2) p^r}{\prod_{i=1}^ms_i}
  \end{equation*}
  \begin{equation*}
    \prod_{i=1}^ms_i = p^{r-t}f(v)
  \end{equation*}
  For $r > t$, this is impossible, and thus the group is cyclic,
  generated by $\overline{D}$. 

  The monodromy pairing on $\Jac(B_S)$ is then entirely determined by
  the value of $\pair{\overline{D}}{\overline{D}}$. Consider the
  following function $f:V(G) \to \Z$:

  \begin{equation*}
    f(v) = 
    \begin{cases}
      0, & v = v_0 \\
      \prod_{i=1}^ms_i, & v = v_0' \\
      j \cdot s_i^{-1}\prod_{k=1}^ms_k, & v = v_{ij}
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}

  It is clear that $\Delta(f) = p^rD$, and hence that
  $\pair{\overline{D}}{\overline{D}} = \frac{\prod_{i=1}^ms_i}{p^r}$.
\end{proof}

The cycle graph $C_n$ and the banana graph $B_n$ are both special
cases of the subdivided banana. As a result, we have:

\begin{cor}
  For any prime $p$ and integer $r$, 
  \begin{equation*}
    \Jac(B_{p^r}) \simeq (\Z/p^r\Z, \pair{\cdot}{\cdot}_1)
  \end{equation*}
  \begin{equation*}
    \Jac(C_{p^r}) \simeq (\Z/p^r\Z, \pair{\cdot}{\cdot}_{-1})
  \end{equation*}
  where $\pair{\cdot}{\cdot}_1$ and $\pair{\cdot}{\cdot}_{-1}$ are the
  pairings on $\Z/p^r\Z$ given by
  \begin{equation*}
    \pair{x}{y}_1 = \frac{xy}{p^r} \qquad \pair{x}{y}_{-1} = \frac{(-1)xy}{p^r}
  \end{equation*}
\end{cor}

\subsection{Groups of odd order}
\label{sec:odd_groups}

Our goal is to use the construction above to build graphs whose
Jacobian is isomorphic to $(\Z/p^r\Z, \pair{\cdot}{\cdot})$ for any
pairing $\pair{\cdot}{\cdot}$. We will first address the simpler
situation, where $p$ is odd. In this case, up to isomorphism, there
are only two pairings on $\Z/p^r\Z$; we will denote these by
$\mathfrak{r}$ and $\mathfrak{n}$, the \emph{residue} and
\emph{nonresidue} pairings, respectively.

Observe that the banana graph $B_{p^r}$ always gives rise to the
residue pairing on $\Z/p^r\Z$. To achieve the nonresidue pairing, we
will use the subdivided banana graph $B_S$ with an appropriately
chosen multiset $S$.

Our approach will rely on quadratic reciprocity, and it will be
necessary to consider the cases $p \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ and $p \equiv 3
\pmod 4$ seperately. We will need to further differentiate between the
cases $r > 1$ and $r = 1$; it is in the latter case that our results
rely on the assumption of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis.

For the $p \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ case, we will need the following
proposition:
\begin{prop}
  \label{prop:q_bound}
  For any prime $p$ and integer $r > 1$, there exist prime quadratic
  nonresidues $q_1 \equiv 1 \pmod 4, q_2 \equiv 3 \pmod 4$, such that
  $q_1$ and $q_2$ are both less than $2\sqrt{p}$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Apply Theorem 1.7 in Pollack, using some Dirichlet character
  arguments I don't understand. 
\end{proof}

GRH gives us an analagous statement for $r=1$:
\begin{prop}[Conditional on GRH]
  \label{prop:q_bound_grh}
  For any prime $p$, there exists a prime quadratic nonresidue $q
  \equiv 3 \pmod 4$ such that $q < 2\sqrt{p}$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Somehow this follows from a result of Oesterle. Again, I don't
  understand it.
\end{proof}

Given a prime $q$ that satisfies the bounds above, we will need to
find a particular way to write it as a sum of two positive integers,
to ensure that our set $S$ has the desired properties. Below, we check
that such a decomposition exists, and that this decomposition provides
the properties we require.

\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:decompose_q}
  Let $q$ be an odd prime, and let $k$ be an integer such that
  $\left(\frac{k}{q}\right) = \left(\frac{-1}{q}\right)$. Then there
  exists $0 < a < q$ such that $a(q-a) \equiv k \pmod q$. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Define a set $R_q$ by 
  \begin{equation*}
    R_q = \left\{\ell \in \F_q : \left(\frac{\ell}{q}\right) = 
    \left(\frac{-1}{q}\right)\right\}
  \end{equation*}
  
  Consider the map $\phi:\F_q \to \F_q$ given by $\phi(x) = -x^2$. The
  image of $\phi$ must be a subset of $R_q$. Furthermore, since the
  polynomial $-x^2 - a$ has at most two roots in $\F_q$ (for any $a$),
  and $|R_q| = (q - 1)/2$, $\phi$ is onto $R_q$.

  Since $k \in R_q$, choose $a$ such that $\phi(a) = k$, and note
  that $k \equiv -a^2 \equiv a(q-a) \pmod q$, as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:exist_q}
  Let $p$ be a prime with $p \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, and let $r$ be an
  integer with $r > 1$. Then there exists a prime $q$, with $\left(
    \frac{q}{p^r} \right) = -1$, and an integer $0 < a < q$ such that
  the quantity
  \[\frac{p^r - a(q-a)}{q}\]
  is a positive integer.

  Moreover, assuming GRH, the above result holds for $r=1$ as well.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Apply Proposition \ref{prop:q_bound} (or, for $r=1$, Proposition
  \ref{prop:q_bound_grh}) to find a nonresidue $q$ with
  $\left(\frac{-1}{q}\right) = \left(\frac{p^r}{q}\right)$, and
  $\frac{q^2}{4} < p^r$. By Lemma \ref{lem:decompose_q}, there exists
  $a$ such that $p^r \equiv a(q-a) \pmod q$. Therefore $p^r - a(q-a)$
  is positive and divisible by $q$, as required.
\end{proof}

We now apply Lemma \ref{lem:exist_q} to show the existence of a set
$S$ corresponding to a subdivided banana graph that gives rise to the
nonresidue pairing.

\begin{prop}
  \label{prop:exist_decomp}
  For any odd prime $p$ and integer $r > 1$, there exists a
  multiset of positive integers $S = \{s_1, \ldots s_m\}$ such that
  $R(S) = p^r$, $\gcd(p, s_i) = 1$ for all $i$, and $\prod_{i=1}^ms_i$
  is a nonresidue modulo $p$.
  
  Furthermore, assuming GRH, the result also holds for $r=1$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  First consider the case that $p \equiv 3 \pmod 4$. Choose $S = \{1,
  p^r-1\}$. Clearly $R(S) = p^r$, and by quadratic reciprocity,
  $s_1s_2 \equiv -1 \pmod {p^r}$ is a nonresidue modulo $p^r$.

  In the case that $p \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, choose $q,a$ as in
  Lemma \ref{lem:exist_q}. Choose

  \[s_1 = a, \quad s_2 =  q-a, \quad s_3 = \frac{p^r - a(q-a)}{q}\]

  It is easy to check that $R(S) = p^r$. $a$ and $q-a$ are both less
  than $p$, so they must be prime to $p$, and if $s_3$ were divisible
  by $p$, then the product $a(q-a)$ would be as well.

  Finally, the quantity $s_1s_2s_3$ is a nonresidue mod $p^r$ iff
  $\dfrac{(-1)(a(q-a))^2}{q}$ is a nonresidue mod $p$. Since $p \equiv
  1 \pmod 4$, $-1$ is a residue modulo $p^r$, and hence the numerator
  of this expression is also a residue. Therefore $\left(
    \frac{s_1s_2s_3}{p^r} \right) = \left( \frac{q}{p^r} \right) =
  -1$, as required.
\end{proof}

For a prime $p$ and integer $r$, given a set $S$ described by
Proposition \ref{prop:exist_decomp}, we see that $B_S \simeq
(\Z/p^r\Z, \mathfrak{n})$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:graph_pairing_grh}]
  If we assume GRH, we can find a set $S$ as in Proposition
  \ref{prop:exist_decomp} for \emph{all} powers of odd primes. Taking
  wedge sums of the subdivided bananas these sets represent, we obtain
  all groups of odd order.
\end{proof}

Finally, we conclude the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:graph_pairing} by
noting that in certain cases, it is still possible to construct a set
$S$ satisfying the conditions required to achieve the nonresidue
pairing:

\begin{prop}
  \label{prop:p_1mod24}
  Let $p$ be an odd prime, not equivalent to $1 \pmod {24}$. Then
  there exists a multiset of positive integers $S$ such that $R(S) =
  p$ and $\prod_{s_i \in S}s_i$ is a nonresidue modulo $p$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  We consider the following cases:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For $p \equiv 3 \pmod 4$, as before, we may use $S = \{1,
    p-1\}$.
  \item For $p \equiv 5 \pmod 8$, use $S = \{1, 1,
    \frac{p-1}{2}\}$. Since $p \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, the product
    $s_1s_2s_3$ is a nonresidue modulo $p$ iff $2$ is a nonresidue
    modulo $p$---which is the case when $p \equiv 5 \pmod 8$.
  \item For $p \equiv 2 \pmod 3$, if $p \equiv 3 \pmod 4$, we are in
    the first case above. Otherwise, we have $p \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, and
    $2$ is a nonresidue modulo $p$. Choose $S = \{1, 1,
    \frac{p-1}{2}\}$ as before.
  \end{itemize}
  
  The only remaining possibility after eliminating these three cases
  is $p \equiv 1 \pmod {24}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  Proposition \ref{prop:p_1mod24} shows that we could provide an
  unconditional proof of Theorem \ref{thm:graph_pairing_grh} if we
  could show that Proposition \ref{prop:q_bound_grh} holds for all
  primes $p \equiv 1 \pmod {24}$. In fact, computer search has
  verified that the proposition holds for all such primes smaller than
  $10^9$.
\end{remark}

\subsection{2-groups}

We now turn to the task of constructing graphs $G$ for which $\Jac(G)
\simeq ((\Z/2^r\Z)^k, \pair{\cdot}{\cdot})$, given positive integers
$r$,$k$ and pairing $\pair{\cdot}{\cdot}$ on $(\Z/2^r\Z)^k$. The
classification of such pairings is somewhat more complicated than that
of the odd prime pairings; however, there are still only finitely many
cases to consider:

\begin{prop}\cite{Miranda1984}
  Let $\mathcal{P}_{2}$ be the semigroup of isomorphism classes of
  2-groups with pairing, under orthogonal sum. $\mathcal{P}_{2}$ is
  generated by the following groups with pairing:

  \[ \AP \simeq (\Z/2^r\Z, \pair{\cdot}{\cdot}), r \ge 1; \quad
  \pair{x}{y} = \frac{xy}{2^r}\]
  \[ \BP \simeq (\Z/2^r\Z, \pair{\cdot}{\cdot}), r \ge 2; \quad
  \pair{x}{y} = \frac{-xy}{2^r}\]
  \[ \CP \simeq (\Z/2^r\Z, \pair{\cdot}{\cdot}), r \ge 3; \quad
  \pair{x}{y} = \frac{5xy}{2^r}\]
  \[ \DP \simeq (\Z/2^r\Z, \pair{\cdot}{\cdot}), r \ge 3; \quad
  \pair{x}{y} = \frac{-5xy}{2^r}\]
  \[ \EP \simeq ((\Z/2^r\Z)^2, \pair{\cdot}{\cdot}), r \ge 1; \quad
  \pair{e_i}{e_j} = 
  \begin{cases}
    0, & i = j\\
    \frac{1}{2^{n}}, & \textrm{otherwise }
  \end{cases}
   \]
   \[ \FP \simeq ((\Z/2^r\Z)^2, \pair{\cdot}{\cdot}), r \ge 2; \quad
   \pair{e_i}{e_j} = 
   \begin{cases}
     \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}, & i = j\\
     \frac{1}{2^{n}}, & \textrm{otherwise }
   \end{cases}
   \]   
   where, in the last two cases, $e_i$ and $e_j$ are generators for
   $\Z/2^r\Z \times \Z/2^r\Z$. 
 \end{prop}

 Our goal is to find families of graphs with Jacobian isomorphic to
 each of the families of groups with pairing given above. We provide
 constructions for some, but not all, of these families. 

 We will be aided by the following lemma:

\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:2group_pairing_mod8}
  Let $\Gamma$ be a finite abelian group of order $2^r$, with pairing
  $\pair{\cdot}{\cdot}$. If $\pair{x}{x} = \frac{a}{2^r}$ for some $x
  \in \Gamma$ and odd positive integer $a$, then $\Gamma$ is cyclic
  generated by $x$.

  Furthermore, for some $c \in \{\pm 1, \pm 3\}$, with $c \equiv a
  \pmod 8$, there is an isomorphism of groups $\phi:\Gamma \to
  \Z/2^r\Z$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    \pair{x}{y} = \frac{c\phi(x)\phi(y)}{2^r}.
  \end{equation*}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  For any $\ell < r$, we have $2^\ell\pair{x}{x} = \pair{2^\ell x}{x}
  = \frac{a}{2^{r - \ell}} \ne 1$, and hence $|x| > 2^\ell$ and
  $\Gamma \simeq \Z/2^r\Z$.

  Note that the four pairing isomorphism classes of cyclic groups of
  order $2^r$ correspond precisely to odd residue classes modulo $8$,
  or equivalently to the units of the ring $\Z/8\Z$.

  For some $c \in \{\pm 1, \pm 3\}$, there must therefore exist an
  isomorphism of groups $\phi:\Gamma \to \Z/2^r\Z$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    \pair{x}{y} = \frac{c\phi(x)\phi(y)}{2^r}
  \end{equation*}

  We must have that $\frac{a}{2^r} = \frac{c\phi(x)^2}{2^r}$. Since
  $a$ is odd, it represents a unit of $\Z/8\Z$, and hence $\phi(x)^2$
  is both a unit and a quadratic residue mod $8$. Therefore $\phi(x)^2
  \equiv 1 \pmod 8$, and $a \equiv c \pmod 8$.
\end{proof}

We will now show that all of the cyclic generators of 2-groups with
pairing are realizable as Jacobians of multigraphs. Throughout the
following, 

\begin{thm} Let $\Gamma \simeq (\Z/2^r\Z,
  \pair{\cdot}{\cdot})$. There exists a graph $G$ such that $\Jac(G)
  \simeq \Gamma$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Observe that $\Jac(B_{2^r}) \simeq \AP$ and $\Jac(C_{2^r}) \simeq
  \BP$, where $B_{2^r}$ and $C_{2^r}$ are respectively the banana and
  cycle graphs on $2^r$ edges. It remains to find constructions for
  graphs providing the groups $\CP$ and $\DP$. 

  By Lemma \ref{lem:2group_pairing_mod8}, it suffices to find graphs
  graphs $G_1$ $G_2$, with $|\Jac(G_1)| = |\Jac(G_2)| = 2^r$, such
  that for some $\overline{D}_1 \in \Jac(G_1), \overline{D}_2 \in
  \Jac(G_2)$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    \pair{\overline{D}_1}{\overline{D}_1}_1 &= \frac{a}{2^r} \\
    \pair{\overline{D}_2}{\overline{D}_2}_2 &= \frac{b}{2^r}
  \end{align*}
  where $\pair{\cdot}{\cdot}_1$ and $\pair{\cdot}{\cdot}_2$ are
  respectively the monodromy pairings on $\Jac(G_1)$ and $\Jac(G_2)$,
  and $a \equiv 3 \pmod 8$, $b \equiv 5 \pmod 8$. 
  
  We consider the cases for even and odd $r$ seperately. For odd $r$,
  let $S = \{1, 2, \frac{2^r - 2}{3}\}$, and let $G_1 = B_S$, $G_2 =
  C_S$.

    \caption{The graphs $B_S$ and $C_S$, for $S = \{1,2,\frac{2^r - 2}{3}\}$}
  \end{figure}

  Consider a function $f:V(B_S) \to \Z$, given below:
  
  \begin{equation*}
    f(v) = 
    \begin{cases}
      0, & v = v_0 \\
      1, & v = v_{21} \\
      2, & v = v_0' \\
      2^n - 4 - j, & v = v_{3j}
    \end{cases}.
  \end{equation*}

  Let $D_1 = (v_{31}) - (v_0)$, and check that $\Delta(f) =
  2^rD_1$. Then $\pair{\overline{D_1}}{\overline{D_1}}_1 =
  \frac{f(v_{31})}{2^r} = \frac{2^r - 3}{2^r}$, as required.

  Now consider a function $f:V(C_S) \to \Z$, given by
  \begin{equation*}
    f(v) = 
    \begin{cases}
      0, & v = v_0\\
      2, & v = v_1\\
      3, & v = v_2
    \end{cases}.
  \end{equation*}

  Let $\overline{D}_2 = (v_2) - (v_0)$, and check that $\Delta(f) =
  2^rD$, so $\pair{\overline{D}_2}{\overline{D}_2}_2 = \frac{3}{2^r}$,
  as required.

  For even $r$, let $S = \{1, 1, 1, \frac{2^r - 1}{3}\}$, and again
  let $G_1 = B_S$ and $G_2 = C_S$.

  For the banana graph, we see that Proposition
  \ref{prop:banana_pairing} shows immediately that $\Jac(B_S)$ is
  cyclic of order $2^r$, with pairing
  \begin{equation*}
    \pair{x}{y} = \dfrac{\frac{2^r-1}{3}xy}{2^r}.
  \end{equation*}
  Since $\frac{2^r - 1}{3} \equiv -3 \pmod 8$, this is the required
  pairing.
  
  For the multicycle graph, consider a function $f:V(C_S) \to \Z$,
  defined by $f(v_i) = i$. Let $D = (v_3) - (v_0)$. Once more, we may
  check that $\Delta(f) = -2^rD$, and hence that
  $\pair{\overline{D}}{\overline{D}} = \frac{3}{2^r}$, as
  required.
\end{proof}

Each of the above constructions gives a graph with cyclic Jacobian,
giving four of the six generators for 2-groups with pairing. We have
few concrete results concerning the remaining two generators. However,
we still make the following observation:

\begin{thm}
  For any $k \ge 1$, there is no graph $G$ such that $\Jac(G) \simeq
  (\mathcal{E}_2)^k$. 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  This is a result of the characterization of graphs $G$ with $\Jac(G)
  \simeq (\Z/2\Z)^k$, given in Remark
  \ref{remark:2group_characterize}. Since the Jacobian of a cycle
  always gives rise to the group $\mathcal{A}_2$, any such graph has
  Jacobian $({A}_2)^k$.
\end{proof}

This result, combined with our failure to find \emph{any} graph $G$
that yields the group $\EP$, leads us to make the following conjecture:

\begin{conj}
  For any $k \ge 1$, there is no graph $G$ such that $\Jac(G) \simeq
  (\EP)^k$.
\end{conj}

We note, however, that there do exist examples of graphs $G$ such that
for some subgroup $H \subset \Jac(G)$, if $\pair{\cdot}{\cdot}\big|_H$
is the monodromy pairing on $\Jac(G)$ restricted to $H$, then $(H,
\pair{\cdot}{\cdot}\big|_H) \simeq \EP$. In particular, take $G =
B_S$, for $S = \{2, 2, 2\}$. The Jacobian of this graph is $(\Z2\Z)^2
\times \Z/3\Z$---this can be seen by applying Theorem
\ref{thm:subdivide}. Inspection shows that the monodromy pairing
restricted to the $2$-part of $\Jac(G)$ is indeed the pairing on
$\mathcal{E}_2$.

We have even fewer results regarding $\FP$. We note that the complete
graph $K_4$ is a graph with Jacobian isomorphic to $\mathcal{F}_4$,
but we are unable to find other examples of graphs that provide this
pairing.

\subsection{Simple graphs}
As in Section 1, some of the constructions given above are only
possible if we allow multiple edges on our graphs. We do not have a
broad result concerning groups with pairing that \emph{can} arise as
Jacobians of multigraphs that \emph{cannot} arise as Jacobians of
simple graphs. However, we observe that such groups do in fact exist:

\begin{thm}
  Let $\Gamma_\mathfrak{r} \simeq (\Z/3\Z, \mathfrak{r})$, and
  $\Gamma_\mathfrak{n} \simeq (\Z/3\Z, \mathfrak{n})$. For any odd
  integer $k$, there is no simple graph $G$ such that
  \begin{align*}
      \Jac(G) \simeq (\Gamma_\mathfrak{r})^k, \text{ or } \\
      \Jac(G) \simeq (\Gamma_\mathfrak{r})^k \times \Gamma_\mathfrak{n}.
  \end{align*}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Lemma \ref{lem:delta_le_mu} shows that the only biconnected simple
graph with Jacobian of the form $(\Z/3\Z)^k$ is the $3$-cycle
$C_3$. The monodromy pairing on $\Jac(C_3)$ is the nonresidue pairing
$\mathfrak{n}$, and the groups with pairing given above do not arise
as powers of $\Z/3\Z$ with this pairing.
\end{proof}
