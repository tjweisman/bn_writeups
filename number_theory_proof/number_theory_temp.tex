Our approach will rely on quadratic reciprocity, and it will be
necessary to consider the cases $p \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ and $p \equiv 3
\pmod 4$ seperately. We will need to further differentiate between the
cases $r > 1$ and $r = 1$; it is in the latter case that our results
rely on the assumption of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis.

For the $p \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ case, we will need the following
proposition:
\begin{prop}
  \label{prop:q_bound}
  For any prime $p$ and integer $r > 1$, there exist prime quadratic
  nonresidues $q_1 \equiv 1 \pmod 4, q_2 \equiv 3 \pmod 4$, such that
  $q_1$ and $q_2$ are both less than $2\sqrt{p}$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
\input{number_theory_proof}
\end{proof}

GRH gives us an analagous statement for $r=1$:
\begin{prop}[Conditional on GRH]
  \label{prop:q_bound_grh}
  For any prime $p$, there exists a prime quadratic nonresidue $q
  \equiv 3 \pmod 4$ such that $q < 2\sqrt{p}$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Somehow this follows from a result of Oesterle. Again, I don't
  understand it.
\end{proof}
