Fix $\varepsilon>0$, and let $\chi_1$ be the nontrivial character modulo 4 and $\chi_2$ be the quadratic character modulo $p$ (i.e., the Legendre symbol modulo $p$). These characters have orders $n_1=n_2=2$. We're looking for a prime $q$ with $\chi_1(q)=\chi_2(q)=-1$, so we want $\chi_1,\chi_2$ to be second roots of unity. These characters form a basis for the group of characters $\mathbb{X}$ associated with the degree 4 extension $K=\Q(i, \sqrt{p})$ of $\Q$. The conductor of this extension is $4p$. Thus letting $d_1=d_2=2$, we apply Theorem 1.7 in [CITE POLLACK] and find that there's a prime $q$ with $\chi_1(q)=\chi_2(q)=-1$ and
\[
q < \kappa_{\varepsilon}p^{1/2 + \varepsilon},
\]
where $\kappa_\varepsilon$ is a constant depending only on $\varepsilon$.
